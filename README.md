Simple-Calculator-with-Method-Chaining

Description :
create and use method chaining

input :
number with integer

output :
calculation result of each method

*Directions :
- create a class named arithmetic
- create a constructor that has a value property and - accept this as the initial value when the class is instantied
- create a method that accepts the paramaters number in integer (add,subtract,divide,multiple) and returns the calculated value, with chaining enabled ( use return this )
- Instantiate the class into an object
- use the method as usual for single calculation
- now use the metod chaining to do a series of calculations

*Rule
*N/A

const two = new Arithmetic(2)
two.multipy(10).subtract(5)
